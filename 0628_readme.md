# How to Use the `CAD_ProblemB.cpp` File

## Part 1: Compiling the `CAD_ProblemB.cpp` File

To compile the `CAD_ProblemB.cpp` file into an executable named `CAD_ProblemB.exe`, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
g++ CAD_ProblemB.cpp -o CAD_ProblemB.exe
```

This command tells the g++ compiler to compile the CAD_ProblemB.cpp source file and produce an executable file named CAD_ProblemB.exe.

## Part 2: Running the CAD_ProblemB.exe File

To run the compiled executable CAD_ProblemB.exe with the input file testcase0.txt and the output file testcase0_output.txt, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
./CAD_ProblemB.exe testcase0.txt testcase0_output.txt
```

This command runs the CAD_ProblemB.exe program and passes testcase0.txt as the input file and testcase0_output.txt as the output file. The program will read data from the input file and write the results to the output file.
